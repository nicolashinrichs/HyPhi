# Miscellaneous Documentation

This directory contains supplementary documentation and tutorial material intended to help users understand and apply the HyPhi pipeline.

## HyPhi_FRC_examples.md

The file `HyPhi_FRC_examples.md` provides a step-by-step tutorial focused on Forman-Ricci curvature analysis in hyperscanning networks.

It demonstrates:

- Loading connectivity matrices
- Constructing inter-brain networks
- Computing Forman-Ricci curvature
- Interpreting curvature dynamics over time

This tutorial complements the synthetic example in `software_module` by illustrating how the same geometric tools are applied to empiric data structures.

## Intended Use

The materials in this directory are not required to run the core pipeline but are recommended for:

- First-time users
- Readers coming from a neuroscience background
- Reproducing figures and analyses used in manuscripts

---

## Scope

Files in `miscellaneous` may evolve independently of the core pipeline and include explanatory material, protocols, and exploratory analyses.
